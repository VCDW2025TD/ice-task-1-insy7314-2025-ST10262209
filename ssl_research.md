SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that encrypt data between a client and server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. TLS is the modern successor to SSL, offering stronger security and better performance. HTTPS, which uses SSL/TLS, is more secure than HTTP because it prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Without SSL/TLS, data transmitted over the network can be intercepted or tampered with, putting sensitive information like passwords and personal details at risk. Real-world incidents have shown that missing or misconfigured SSL certificates can lead to security breaches, service outages, and increased vulnerability to attacks.
